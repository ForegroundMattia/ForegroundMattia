<h2 align="left">About Me </h2>
I am a passionate developer driven by curiosity to learn new frameworks, and I always want to know other points of view and share my own to grow together.<br> 
I am a theater technician specialized in lighting, video and audio, in particular I am very familiar with QLab.
I have high competence in Discord.js, because I'm a community manager, I still create many utility bots for those.

I thank Apple Developer Academy for teaching me and improving my softskills, starting from personal ones (like time management, problem solving, analytical and critical thinking) to finish in relational ones (like public speaking skills and the ability to relate and manage teammates).
